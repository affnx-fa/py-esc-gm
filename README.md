# py-esc-gm
project supported by school, encouraged by CS teacher.

base code in python and if completed within a time frame whats undecided as of now, convert to java or a different language what is able to be executed on a website, hosted by me on a local repository.

website hosted using GitHub Pages and domain from a free domain provider such as freenom etc, 

questions to do with subjects and combines different ones such as a question about computer science in french as an extra challenge.

readily available hints for questions on the program and puzzles in the escape room to be created in ex- POST16 (honestly the most difficult part if put into motion)

partial clues needed to solve the puzzle will be images what partially reveal the location of items needed, not meant to be overly obvious.

for items such as keys etc will be 3D printed and designed in C.A.D -or computer assisted design.
